## Summary

Forge is an open community that welcomes all people, regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, **or any other classification**. To avoid common pitfalls, we disallow discussion of topics such as politics and religion. We are a modding community and there are other places for those types of discussions.

Everything in this document can be summed up with, for lack of a better term, “don’t be a dick”. What that means to us will be described below.

## Scope

This document applies to everyone while in the Forge project communities, and to people from the Forge Team (or given authority to speak on behalf of the Forge project) when acting as an official spokesperson for the Forge Project outside those communities. Anything said by Team members when not on official business is their own opinion and not that of the Project. The Forge communities include:

* On **GitHub**: The [MinecraftForge organization](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/) and all its repositories. Issues and Pull Requests need to be mindful of this Code of Conduct and the Rules of the forge communities.
* On **Discord**: The [Forge Project discord](https://discord.gg/UvedJ9m) community server.
* The **[Forge Forums](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/)** at the minecraftforge.net site.
* On **Twitter**: The official Twitter account ([@ForgeDevTeam](https://twitter.com/ForgeDevTeam)). Replies to tweets from the Forge dev team are subject to the same rules as the other communities.

## Expected behaviour

People on the Forge communities or speaking on behalf of the Forge project are expected to:

* Treat people with **respect**: by default, even if someone is being disrespectful towards the community or individual community members.
    * To avoid perpetuating or escalating conflict, refrain from interacting with them further, beyond notifying a moderator. Infractions will be evaluated by the moderation team, and they will take appropriate action. 
* Avoid jumping to conclusions: if you believe that someone may be attempting to bypass the rules, or may be unknowingly breaking the rules, always ask for clarification first, before assuming the worst.
    * If proof is obtained, report it to the moderators. As above, avoid confrontation. It is the job of the moderation team to evaluate the situation and take appropriate action.
* Be **accepting** of constructive criticism: Understand that not everything we do is perfect, and there is always room for improvement. Differing opinions should be treated as such, and not as personal attacks.
    * Note that constructive criticism does not mean you need to “turn the other cheek”. If the person is being actively aggressive or dismissive against you, it is no longer constructive. Constructive criticism is **always** accompanied by suggestions of how to improve, and **never** by attacks on the person’s skill or intelligence.
* Keep the **community** in mind: There’s often times where the preferences of one person are generalized to assume the whole community has the same needs. This is rarely the case. Solutions should attempt to be as general as possible, instead of focusing on niches.
* Follow the **rules** of each community: There’s specific rules present on the Forge communities which we expect people to follow. The rules are not legal text, just guidelines. Trying to find loopholes based on the wording of the rules will not excuse you from breaking those rules, and will in fact worsen the severity of the infraction.
    * Remember the terms of use of Minecraft and of each service. These take precedence over any rule that might conflict with them.

## Discouraged and Disallowed topics

In the spirit of maintaining a stable and friendly environment, the scope of discussion in the Forge communities is limited:

* **Politics and Religion**: Discussion of political and religious topics is disallowed because of their subjective nature and the strong feelings often associated with those topics.
* **Hate Speech**: Racist, sexist, and any other language that discriminates, diminishes, mocks, or otherwise attacks certain people based on their beliefs, appearance or behaviour will not be tolerated.
* **Other Modding Frameworks/APIs**: The Forge project is aware that there exist other ways to create and load code into Minecraft. Discussions of those APIs have a tendency to result in comparisons and tend to bundle the users of those APIs in those comparisons (“X is better than forge so because I prefer X, I’m better than you”), so those discussions are disallowed.
* **Advertisement/Spam**: It is not allowed to use the Forge communities to advertise your products and services. This includes linking to other discord servers and websites.
    * Showcasing of the mods you have developed in the designated channels is allowed, and not within the scope of this rule. However, linking to Discord servers related to those mods is not allowed unless prompted by someone asking about it.
* **Copyright Infringement, Cheating, ToS Infringement**: It is not allowed to suggest, teach, or otherwise support topics that infringe the intellectual rights of others. This includes running Minecraft without a license, running cheat clients that bypass server limitations, selling content prohibited by the Minecraft EULA, and any other similar infringement.
    * This includes the Discord, Twitter and GitHub Terms of Use, as those services are hosting the Forge communities.
    * We assume that anyone talking about a “client” is referring to cheat clients. Please use the term “mod” or “modpack” to refer to those that don’t include cheats. And yes, “pvp utility mods” are cheats.
* **Coremodding, Jarmodding, or otherwise bypassing the Forge API**: Discussion of direct bytecode manipulation in mods (coremods, mixins) is not allowed, with the exception of the dedicated channel on the Discord server as described in the discord server rules. Jarmodding, a practice where the modified changes are applied straight to the game code without a mod loader, is forbidden in all cases.
    * This prohibition exists because forge’s primary goal is to eliminate the need for the average mod to resort to these tools, and by having unnecessary modifications of the vanilla code in mods, those mods are potentially introducing incompatibilities with other mods that expect the original behaviour, and those that choose to change the same code in incompatible ways.
    * The non-api channel is for cases where a feature could not realistically be included in the Forge codebase due to performance, intrusivity, or when it’s unjustifiable due to its niche use. Discussion about the development of coremods that could have been Forge features -- that is, when the coremods do not fit this exception -- is not allowed.
    * Feature requests and Pull Requests should avoid using language that suggests a feature should be merged in order to avoid the publication or continued existence of a coremod. This includes “Proof of Concept” coremods ready to be released if the PR isn’t merged, and phrasing such as “the only alternative is a coremod”, both of which will be assumed to be threats to release such coremods if the feature isn’t merged.

## Moderation policy

There will be three levels of moderation action, based on the severity of the infractions, taking into account repeated offenses:

1. **Light**: A warning is given, along with an explanation of why the warning was warranted. While the warnings do not expire and will remain in the moderation log, older warnings may or may not, at the discretion of the moderators, be taken into account when evaluating the severity of future actions.
2. **Moderate**: The person is muted for a certain amount of time, giving them a chance to reflect, and correct their behaviour. Like in Light infractions, it should be accompanied by an explanation.
3. **Severe**: The person is banned from the community. The ban may be timed, or permanent, depending on the cause. This action can be extended to other Forge communities, if preemptive action is warranted by the severity.

Infraction severity will be evaluated based on a number of factors:

1. All infractions are **Light** by default, unless they match one of the following conditions.
2. If the behaviour is **actively damaging** to specific people (personal attacks, bullying, harassing), it will be considered **Moderate**.
3. If the behaviour is **spammy** (posting on multiple channels, pasting the same message repeatedly, or there’s suspicion of it being automated) or **illegal** (such as scams, illegal porn, etc.), such that it is considered an active attack and not just a one-time infraction, it will be considered **Severe**.
4. If the behaviour is repeated after receiving initial moderation action, showing no intention to correct this behaviour, it will be **upgraded to the next severity level**. This means repeat offenders of a Light infraction will receive Moderate action, and repeat offenders after a Moderate infraction will receive Severe action. It is the moderator’s discretion to decide when reincidence requires a severity upgrade.

Examples of behaviours and actions that warrant different severity levels. This list is not exhaustive and only shows some examples of how moderation severity needs to be evaluated:

* **Failing to read the rules** of the community and informing oneself of this Code of Conduct, and refusing to do so when directed: **Light infraction.**
* Talking about **disallowed topics**, such as discussion of other modding frameworks or political opinions: **Light infraction**.
    * Intentionally stirring heated conversation (flame wars) by mentioning topics that are known to cause polarized opinions. **Moderate infraction.**
* **Spam**, such as posting links to other discord servers or offering services and products, without being prompted by an ongoing conversation. **Light infraction.**
    * If repeated in multiple channels at the same time. **Severe infraction.**
* **Unwarranted Private Messages** sent without prompt and not following up from a conversation in the public communities. **Light infraction.**
* Sending **pornography** or other content that would not be legally allowed to people under 18 years old. **Severe infraction.**
    * This applies only to **sexually explicit content**, and does not include humor and jokes, unless those are themselves sexually explicit. Remember that discord’s Terms of Service disallow children under 13 to use the service, as per the rules of the COPPA.

Moderators are expected to carry out moderation action based on an objective evaluation of the severity as described above, while maintaining the expected behaviour in their interaction with the infractor.

Sometimes people fail to listen when being told that their actions or behaviour are not acceptable, and only respond when receiving a metaphorical “slap in the cheek”. The Forge project reserves the right to metaphorically yell at these people, without resorting to personal attacks. We apologize in advance if we misjudge when this is necessary.

When deemed appropriate or necessary, infractions in the Forge communities hosted in 3rd party services will be reported to the corresponding platform’s Trust and Safety team. 

## Reporting misbehaviour and infractions

There’s multiple ways to get the attention of the team, based on the context of the witnessed infraction

* **Spam on public Discord channels**: Mention (ping) the @Moderator role if there hasn’t been any indication that they are already managing the situation, and they haven’t yet been alerted by someone else. One mention is plenty.
    * Include an explanation of what the ping was for, in case the original message gets deleted.
    * Do not delete moderation pings, even if the original message has been removed. This is to avoid confusion for moderators that weren’t active at the time.
* **Rule breaking actions witnessed in public channels**: Mention (ping) the @Moderator role if there hasn’t been any indication that they are already managing the situation, and they haven’t yet been alerted by someone else. One mention is plenty.
    * Include an explanation of what the ping was for, in case the original message gets deleted.
    * Do not delete moderation pings, even if the original message has been removed. This is to avoid confusion for moderators that weren’t active at the time.
* **Personal attacks, spam or scams sent via Private Message**: Contact one of the moderators either on the public channels or, if private, via Direct Messages.
    * Do report people to the respective platform’s Trust and Safety.
* **Infractions from the Triage, Moderation, or Core Team**: report to someone from the Core Team, via private message. Provide as much proof as possible, including screenshots and, if it happened in a public place, links to the messages. Try to avoid direct confrontation. The Core Team will evaluate the situation internally. 

We do not promise to provide a public answer to any infraction report. Actions will be taken as needed, when needed. This does not mean that we will not acknowledge or thank you for the report, just that we may choose to not give an opinion or resolution in public.

## Disclaimer

We are aware that some members of the team have difficulty interacting with others in a way that avoids sounding harsh or rude. Please understand that their wording is not intended to offend, and they are just stating things in the way they perceive them. In other words, they are “brutally honest”.

Lex understands he falls in this category, apologizes for any misunderstandings and displeasure caused by his words, and has set up teams to handle public interaction on his behalf, while he continues doing the effort of managing the project. However, as leader of the team he is still present in the Forge communities and will, on occasion, choose to make his presence known and take moderative action as needed.

In his words, included by his own request: He knows he’s a dick, he is actively trying not to be a dick in public, and we are free to call him when there’s a need to address a user that is asking for one.
