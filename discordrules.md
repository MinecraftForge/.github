**Rules:**
    1. Do not ping people unnecessarily.
    2. Do not PM anyone with a rank without asking permission first.
    3. Do not ask for release dates. This includes "rough ETAs" etc. We know when updates are released. Follow the Github for progress.
    4. No spamming. This includes emoji and many single word messages.
    5. Do not ask/beg for roles, they are assigned manually by the moderators when they see fit.
    6. Please keep on topic. There is lenience but don't push it.
    7. Don't argue with mods. They have final say in everything.
    8. Don't be a dick. Seriously. It's not that difficult.
    9. Don't talk about coremodding or mixins outside the designated channel: <#733055378371117127>
      a. We reserve the right not to support your endeavours into pointless coremodding or mixins. If there's a way to do it without a coremod or mixin, we will happily tell you how.
    10. Don't talk about other modding systems here. We know about fabric, sponge and a dozen others. You don't need to tell us about them. AGAIN. This is the Forge discord. Talk about Forge.
    11. Don't ask about old versions. There are support communities for legacy versions of modded minecraft, where you'll find lots of new friends. No, we're not a directory, and we don't have invites to hand out.
    12. We will try and support your problems in <#437001959950778368>, but problems get fixed all the time. We can only reasonably support the latest recommended build and very recent beta builds. If you can't reproduce your problem, we reserve the right not to help you.

**Regarding the new Chat Reporting feature in 1.19.1**
Mojang is adding a new feature in 1.19.1 that lets people report chat messages, and those reports may lead to people getting banned from Multiplayer modes of Minecraft.
We understand that many people don't agree with the way this feature is being implemented, but we don't know yet what Mojang and Microsoft's moderation policy will look like, and what kinds of bans they will give.
Until we have more information, we will go along with what we believe is Mojang's intention, and we'll consider that anything that allows you to bypass bans or prevents others from reporting you, is dishonest and so it falls in the same category as cheating or capes.
That means, even tho mods for this can be made, we will not support, encourage, or allow advertising of those mods in this community.
We may reevaluate this decision in the future.
TL;DR: whatever you do outside our community is not our concern, just don't get us involved.
